# zimbatm's cafe

No beverages included.

Working remotely can be lonely sometimes. Come and join us in this virtual
room. Just be hack on things and have coffees. Or teas. Teas are also welcome.

## Etiquette

* Be nice :-)
* You can use private spaces to have 1:1 conversations. These are located
  around the tables.
* Try not to barge into other people's conversations too much.
* Turn on your camera. The point is to see other working and make this
  symmetrical.
* Mute yourself if you have a noisy background environment.

## Ideas

It would be nice to have some background music or a DJ. Maybe tied to a
Spotify or YouTube Music account? https://askubuntu.com/questions/421014/share-an-audio-playback-stream-through-a-live-audio-video-conversation-like-sk

It would be nice if the cafe was open source so we could hack on it and try
new ideas.
