# Dark Mode


## Websites

Websites that provide a dark theme.

Ideally they would respect [`prefers-color-scheme: dark`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).

### Browser extension

For all the sites that are not supported: https://darkreader.org/

## Browser Support

### Safari

Out of the box

### Firefox

Ships since Firefox 67.

The feature is disabled if the `privacy.resistFingerprinting` option is set to
`true`.

To force a value, create a new entry in `about:config`.

* name: `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme`
* type: `int`
* values: `0` (light) `1` (dark)

If you would like to have a quick method to toggle that setting as an add-on, you can also install [this Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/dark-mode-website-switcher/?src=external-zimbatm).
