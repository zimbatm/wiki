# Dark Mode

Dark Mode is an idea promulgated by Apple; invert the theme to use a dark
background and light text instead.

## Websites

Websites that provide a dark theme.

Ideally they would respect [`prefers-color-scheme: dark`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).

| Site          | Supports | Notes                                       |
| ---           | ---      | ---                                         |

### Browser extension

For all the sites that are not supported: https://darkreader.org/

I noticed that this extension can take quite a bit of CPU. I assume it is
needed to calculate the inverted colors.

## Browser Support

### Safari

Out of the box

### Firefox

Ships since Firefox 67.

The feature is disabled if the `privacy.resistFingerprinting` option is set to
`true`.

To force a value, create a new entry in `about:config`.

* name: `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme`
* type: `int`
* values: `0` (light) `1` (dark)

If you would like to have a quick method to toggle that setting as an add-on, you can also install [this Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/dark-mode-website-switcher/?src=external-zimbatm).

### Qutebrowser

Add the line `c.colors.webpage.darkmode.enabled = True;` to `config.py`, then restart qutebrowser (e.g. by running `:restart` in the qutebrowser prompt).

### Chromium

Navigate to `chrome://flags/`, then enable the flag `#enable-force-dark`, then relaunch Chromium.
