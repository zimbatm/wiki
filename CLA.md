# On Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

CLA exist for the benefit of corporations. They want to profit from our free labor, but not take legal risks of potential copyright mis-attributions. Of course this means that this shifts the burden to the contributor. I am sorry but I am not going to sign a legal document, with all the risks attached with it, or pay a lawyer, on top of providing free contribution.

If you want my contributions, this should be enough:
* I am giving you my word that I have the right to distribute the change. 
* My contributions are licensed under the same license as the
  target project at the time of the contribution.

That's all. Thanks!

Here is a more lengthy version that explains the situation pretty well:
