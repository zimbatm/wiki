# Bisect Debugging

Debugging problems are rarely thrown our way at times that are conventient to
us.

The product launch is tomorrow and some obscure error is keeping the developer
awake many hours past curfew.

TODO: insert more debugging scenarios in here

What if there was an easy way to approach debugging?

## Bisect debugging

What if... 



The debugger is usually faced with their own code, so they must first be faced
with they own falliability. Negative emotions impair the debugger's judgement
and can also lead to procrastination (procrastination is an emotion management
issue). This is a long struggle and the best way I found so far is to make
debugging mechanical enough so that not too much thinking needs to be
involved.

The secret is to apply this simple formula: apply bisecting to all debugging
problem. The nice thing about binary search is that it's guaranteed to find
the problem in O(log N).
