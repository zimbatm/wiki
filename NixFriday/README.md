Nix Friday is a weekly stream where we talk about Nix and related technologies.

The format has changed a bit over time. Initially it was all about teaching
Nix. Now, I want to mostly interview and put the spotlight on community
members mostly. There are too many people doing amazing things, and don't get
the recognition they deserve.
