## Hi!

![alpaca](img/alpaca.png)

Hi, I am zimbatm on the Internet. If you see a zimbatm on a website it's
probably me. Nobody else has thought that this was a good nickname to pick for
some reason that escapes me :p

Yes, I have a [Kongregate](https://www.kongregate.com/accounts/zimbatm)
account and other ridiculous places.

In general I like to build things. Mostly software because I am too lazy to
get off my butt. Why go out when there is this perfectly reasonable interface
to the world?

## This website

This website is an experiment that combines [vimwiki](vimwiki.md) with github
pages to maintain a personal [diary](diary.md) and wiki. For more info, see the
[README](README.md) page.

I used to worry about permanent URLs but not anymore. Make sure to scape the
hell out of the website if you want to keep some information!

No analytics or tracking cookies here. Enjoy one of the last corners of the
free Internet!
